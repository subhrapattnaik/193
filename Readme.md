\
create a virtual network using Cisco Packet Tracer
----------------------------------------------------------------


\Learn about the internet.
\
● Download and Install Cisco Packet Tracer.
\
● Create network simulation

--------------------------------------------------------------
what is a internet, how the internet works and what are the key components of a internet.
-------------------------------------------------------------
SCenario-1
----------
you do not have any internet and any storage devic with you.
\how would you transfer the files/projects to the other computer?

Ans:
Use USB ports where you connect the USB cable with the other computer and transfer the files.
This is the very basic type of a network where two computers are connected with each other and sharing the
data.
-----------------------
Scenario-2
---------
now instead of sharing the file with only 1 computer, you want to share the files with your entire class.

\
In your school’s computer lab, you have 20 computers and you want to share your project with all the other students as
well. How can we do this?
\

Ans:

There is a need for a device that can function as an extension device, providing us with a lot of USB ports for
connecting to other computers.Fortunately, we have such a device. It is known as the Switch.
\
Switch: Switch is a device that is used to connect multiple computer devices
\--------
With the help of the switch, we can connect more than two computers with each other.
One problem is solved, we are able to connect all the computers in our lab.
\
Scenario-3
--------

How would you choose the computer onto which you want to send the data?

The IP address is a unique set of numbers assigned to a computer on a network.
\
Here IP stands for Internet Protocol which simply means a set of rules which govern the internet.
\The IP address is a set of 4 numbers separated by a . dot.
\● Each number can range from 0-255.
\● A special number 255 is used in some computing tasks. It is the maximum value that can be represented by an eight-digit binary number.
\● 192.168.1.1 is an example of an IP address.


\\\
on a network of computers, two computers can not have the same IP address.
\So with the help of a networking device we can connect multiple computers and using an IP address we can identify the computer.
\Once you know the IP address of the computer you will be able to share the information with that computer
\This is called a Local Area Network or LAN because all the computers are on the same network.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Local Area Network: A local area network (LAN) consists of a group of devices connected in one physical location,
such as a building, office, or home. The computers in a LAN connection to each other via the Internet and using IP
address we will find the exact address of the computer. Here we cannot communicate with the outside world. By
outside world, we mean with other LANs
-----------------------------------------
\\\\
Screnario-4
-----------

But let’s say you have one school in one city and another school in a different city. How can we transmit the data
\now? That is where we can use a different set of devices. First, we need a place where we can send all the
\information; this is usually called a server.

Servers :
-------
\
Server:It is a computer that provides data of many kinds to a user or client. Typically, a server will only perform a few
\actions for many clients. Every action taken by a server is called a service. Services are used by computers called
\clients.

-------------------------------------------

Scenario-5
---------
\what if we want to communicate with two or more servers?
\
For that we need a different device called Routers
\Routers: Routers are computers that are specialized to move data between servers and computers. They ensure
\that data transfers between computers take place where they should. So we connect our computer with the router and the router
\connects us to the server

\Internet\
Now we can send the information to the server and through that server the information will reach the other lab.
So basically when all devices combined they form a network which is called Internet network
Basically, all devices combine to form a network, which is called the Internet

\Cisco Packet tracer is a free software from Cisco. We will download this softwar

download --install---

CiscoPacket Tracer or CPT is a very powerful software we
can create and simulate various networks.
The screen interface is very simple. At the top we have allthe menu options and at the bottom we have networking

devices such as computers, servers, routers etc.
We will explore these devices in upcoming classes.
